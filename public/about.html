**“I’m a beginner web developer who builds simple, clean websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.<br/> I focus on learning fast, improving my skills, and creating projects that actually work.<br/> I’m still leveling up, but I’m consistent, curious, and always pushing to get better with every project.”**
