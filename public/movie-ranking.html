    My Best Movies Of All-Time.

<hr>

<h3>
    The Godfather
</h3>

<p>
A mafia masterpiece. Sharp writing, flawless acting, and a story that builds real tension. It’s the blueprint for crime dramas</p>

<h3>
    The Godfather 2
</h3>

<p>
A rare sequel that matches the original. Deeper, darker, and shows the rise of Vito vs. the fall of Michael. Pure cinematic peak.</p>


<h3>
    The Godfather 3
</h3>


<p>
Not on the same level, but still solid. It closes Michael’s story with guilt, power, and consequences. Underrated if you watch it with the right expectations.</p>
